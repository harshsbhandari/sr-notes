# Bitcoin and Blockchain
The Bitcoin Whitepaper, authored by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, described how Bitcoin could facilitate peer-to-peer transactions within 
a decentralized network using cryptography. This gave rise to censorship-resistant finance and presented Bitcoin as a superior digital store of value, 
often referred to as digital gold. There is a fixed amount of Bitcoin, similar to the scarcity of gold.

# Ethereum and Smart Contract
A few years after Bitcoin's creation, Vitalik Buterin and others founded Ethereum, which builds upon the blockchain infrastructure but with additional 
capabilities. With Ethereum, you can create decentralized transactions, organizations, and agreements without a centralized intermediary. 
This was achieved through the addition of **smart contracts**. Smart contracts are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the 
need for a centralized or third-party intermediary. Smart contract functionality is the primary difference between blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. 
Technically, Bitcoin does have smart contracts, but they're intentionally Turing incomplete.

# The Oracle Problem
Smart contracts face a significant limitation — they cannot interact with or access data from the real world. This is known as the **oracle problem**.
**Oracles** serve this purpose. They are devices or services that provide data to blockchains or run external computation. 
To maintain decentralization, it's necessary to use a decentralized oracle network rather than relying on a single source. 
This combination of on-chain logic with off-chain data leads to **hybrid smart contracts**.

# Chainlink
**Chainlink** is a popular decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to access external data and computation. 
Chainlink is also blockchain agnostic — so it works with any chain out there.

# Layer 2 Scaling Solutions
As blockchains grow, they face scaling issues. **Layer 2 (L2)** solutions have been developed to address this. 
L2 solutions involve other blockchains hooking into the main blockchain, essentially allowing it to scale. There are two primary types of L2 solutions:

- **Optimistic Rollups**: e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum
- **Zero-Knowledge Rollups**: e.g., ZKsync, Polygon ZK EVM

# Blockchain
In web3, a blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a secure and decentralized manner. 
Each block contains a number of transactions, and every new block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain. This makes the data tamper-resistant.

# Smart Contract
In web3, a smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. 
They run on blockchains and automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.

# Ethereum/EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
Ethereum is a blockchain platform known for its smart contract functionality. 
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is its computation engine that executes smart contracts. 
Ethereum allows developers to build decentralized applications and is the basis for many web3 projects.

# Key Phases of the Web:
- **Web1**: The permissionless open-source web with static content.
- **Web2**: The permissioned web with dynamic content where companies run your agreements on their servers.
- **Web3**: The permissionless web with dynamic content, decentralized censorship-resistant networks, and user-owned ecosystems.

# Key Features and Benefits of Blockchain

## Decentralization
Smart contracts operate on decentralized networks maintained by nodes, which remove the need for central intermediaries.

## Transparency and Flexibility
All transactions and contract executions on the blockchain are visible to everyone, ensuring transparency and fairness. 
Additionally, pseudoanonymity ensures that privacy is maintained, since accounts are not tied to real-life identities.

## Speed and Efficiency
Blockchain transactions are instant, unlike traditional bank transfers that can take days or weeks to execute. 
This efficiency extends to financial settlements, eliminating the need for clearing houses and reducing settlement times.

## Security and Immutability
Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be altered, ensuring that the terms remain unchanged. 
Hacking a blockchain is extremely challenging due to its decentralized nature, offering a more secure method 
for protecting information compared to centralized systems.

## Reduced Counterparty Risk
Smart contracts remove the need for trust in intermediaries, ensuring that agreements are executed as coded without the 
risk of human interference or fraud.
