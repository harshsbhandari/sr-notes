# Public and Private Keys
The relationship between private and public keys is essential to grasping the concept of blockchain transactions.

- **Private Key**: A randomly generated secret key used to sign all transactions.
- **Public Key**: Generated from the private key using an algorithm (e.g., Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm for Ethereum and Bitcoin).

## Key Characteristics:
- **Private Key** must remain secret and secure.
- **Public Key** is accessible to everyone and is used to verify transactions.

When a transaction is sent to the blockchain, the private key signs it. This allows others to verify the transaction through the public key.

# How Does Transaction Signing Happen?
- Signing a transaction involves digitally signing some data with the private key.
- The **hashing algorithm** ensures that it's impossible to derive the private key from the message signature.
- The message signature allows anyone to verify the validity of a transaction by comparing it to the user's public key.
