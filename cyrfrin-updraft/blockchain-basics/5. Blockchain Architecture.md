# Understanding Hard Forks: How Ethereum Evolves

## Blockchain Upgrades in a Decentralized Network
- Ethereum evolves through upgrades introducing new features, security, and performance improvements.
- Upgrades require global coordination among developers, node operators, and users, unlike centralized OS updates.
- Upgrades can affect consensus mechanisms, transaction processing, fees, smart contracts, and security.

## Hard Forks: Definition and Impact
- A hard fork is a **non-backward-compatible** protocol upgrade.
- Nodes not updated to new rules cannot validate new blocks and are left on an old incompatible chain.
- The new chain moves forward, forcing nodes to upgrade or stay behind.

## Governance Process: Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)
- EIPs are formal documents proposing changes, undergoing:
    1. Drafting
    2. Review and community discussion
    3. Last call for feedback
    4. Final acceptance and scheduling
- Ensures thorough vetting and community consensus before implementation.

## Types of Hard Forks

### Non-Contentious Hard Forks (Planned Upgrades)
- Community agrees on the upgrade; coordinated software update occurs.
- Examples:
    - **The Merge:** PoW to PoS transition.
    - **The London Upgrade:** Introduced EIP-1559 gas fee overhaul and fee-burning.
    - **The Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade:** Proto-Danksharding for scalability and lower Layer 2 fees.

### Contentious Hard Forks (Chain Splits)
- Occur when community disagreements cause permanent chain splits.
- Famous case: **The DAO Fork (2016)**
    - A hack stole ~$150M ETH.
    - Majority voted for a hard fork to reverse the theft (Ethereum).
    - Minority rejected fork, continuing original chain (Ethereum Classic).

## Implementation Process
1. Proposal gains consensus.
2. Multiple client teams implement approved EIPs ensuring client diversity.
3. Rigorous testing on public testnets.
4. Activation scheduled at a specific block, with advance notice for node upgrades.
5. Nodes that upgrade enforce new rules; others remain on old chain.

## Role of Node Operators and Users
- Node operators have final decision power by choosing software versions.
- Developers create code; users show preference via economic support.
- The hard fork mechanism acts as a network defense to preserve integrity after incidents.

# EIPs vs. ERCs: Understanding Ethereum's Core Standards

## What is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)?
- A formal design document proposing new features, processes, or standards for Ethereum's core protocol or clients.
- Anyone can write and submit an EIP for consideration.
- EIP lifecycle:
    1. Drafted: Idea formalized.
    2. In Review: Community scrutinizes proposal for feasibility and security.
    3. Last Call: Final review period for concerns.
    4. Final: Becomes official standard once approved and implemented.

## Types of EIPs
- Core: Changes to consensus protocol requiring network-wide upgrade.
- Networking: Improvements to node communication protocols.
- Interface: Standards for client APIs and interaction.
- ERC: Application-level standards (subset of EIPs).
- Meta: Changes to the EIP process itself.
- Informational: General guidelines without protocol changes.

## What is an Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC)?
- A specific type of EIP focused on application layer standards.
- Ensures interoperability of tokens, smart contracts, and applications.
- All ERCs are EIPs, but not vice versa.

## Importance of ERC Standards
- Enables interoperability in wallets, decentralized exchanges, and NFT marketplaces.
- Examples:
    - ERC-20: Fungible tokens standard.
    - ERC-721: Non-fungible tokens standard.
    - ERC-1155: Multi-token standard supporting fungible and non-fungible tokens.
    - ERC-165: Interface detection.
    - ERC-4626: Standard for tokenized yield-bearing vaults.
    - ERC-712: Structured data signing for improved security.

## Conclusion
- EIPs drive Ethereum's evolution through community-driven upgrades.
- ERCs create vital rules for application interoperability.
- Anyone can contribute to Ethereum’s improvement in this decentralized process.

# A Deep Dive into Ethereum Gas Fees

## Why Gas Fees Are Necessary
- Compensate validators for computational work securing the network.
- Prevent spam by imposing a financial cost on transactions.
- Gas fees fluctuate based on supply and demand for limited block space.

## What is Gas?
- Gas is the unit measuring computation required for operations on Ethereum.
- Acts as fuel for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- Transactions consist of recipient, value, action, and gas fee, signed by sender.

## Evolution of Ethereum Transactions
### Type 0: Legacy Transactions
- Used a first-price auction bidding system with `gasPrice` and `gasLimit`.
- Resulted in unpredictable fees and delayed transactions under congestion.

### Type 2: EIP-1559 Transactions
- Introduced a fee market with a **base fee** (burned) and optional **priority fee (tip)**.
- Base fee adjusts dynamically based on block fullness to stabilize fees.
- Priority fee incentivizes validators to prioritize transactions.
- This model improves predictability and efficiency of gas fees.

## Practical Guide to Gas Fees
- Gas prices use denominations: Wei (smallest unit) and Gwei (common unit for fees).
- Block explorers show gas limits, used gas, base fee, priority fee, and burnt ETH.
- Wallets like MetaMask automate fee calculations but allow advanced manual control.

# Unlocking Web3: A Guide to Account Abstraction

## The Problem: Ethereum's Two-Account System
- **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs):** Controlled by private keys; can initiate transactions but are not programmable.
- **Smart Contract Accounts:** Programmable but cannot initiate transactions themselves; must be triggered by EOAs.
- This separation limits flexibility and user experience.

## Technical Overview: EIP-4337
- Implements Account Abstraction without changing Ethereum's core protocol.
- Introduces:
    1. **User Operations:** Pseudo-transactions expressing user intent.
    2. **Alt Mempool:** Separate mempool for User Operations.
    3. **Bundlers:** Nodes that bundle User Operations into one Ethereum transaction and pay gas.
    4. **Entry Point Contract:** Verifies and executes User Operations via Smart Wallets.
