# An Introduction to Blockchain Tokens

## What Are Tokens?
- Digital representations of value or utility on a blockchain.
- Managed by smart contracts.
- Can represent currency, ownership rights, voting power, or access.

## Core Types of Tokens

### Native Tokens
- Integral to a blockchain's core protocol.
- Used for gas fees, network security (staking), governance.
- Examples: ETH (Ethereum), BTC (Bitcoin), SOL (Solana).

### Fungible Tokens
- Interchangeable and divisible.
- Usually follow the ERC20 standard on Ethereum.
- Examples include stablecoins (USDC), utility tokens (LINK), governance tokens (UNI), reward tokens.

### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- Unique, indivisible digital assets.
- Use the ERC721 standard.
- Examples: digital art, ENS domains, in-game assets.

### Semi-Fungible Tokens
- Hybrid of fungible and non-fungible.
- Follow ERC1155 standard.
- Use cases: event tickets, in-game items, token gating, certifications.

## Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs)
- Digital tokens representing physical or traditional assets.
- Examples: real estate, US treasuries, gold, private equity.
- Benefits: accessibility, tradability, efficiency.

## Stablecoins Types
1. Fiat-backed (e.g., USDC, USDT) — centralized, fully backed by fiat.
2. Crypto-backed (e.g., DAI) — overcollateralized by crypto assets, decentralized.
3. Algorithmic — use algorithms to maintain peg.

## Acquiring and Trading Tokens
- Centralized Exchanges (CEXs): intermediated trading (Coinbase, Binance).
- Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): peer-to-peer on-chain swaps (Uniswap, Curve).
