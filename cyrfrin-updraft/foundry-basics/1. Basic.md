# Foundry Fundamentals

Welcome to Foundry 101, a course designed to teach you how to develop smart contracts and protocols using leading web3 tools such as 
**Chainlink**, **Alchemy**, and **Foundry**.

## What is Foundry?

- Foundry is a modern, modular smart contract development framework.
- It manages dependencies, compiles projects, runs tests, deploys contracts, and allows chain interactions through CLI and Solidity scripts.
- Key advantages:
    - Uses Rust for compilation, providing much faster build times compared to other frameworks like Hardhat or Brownie.
    - Fully Solidity-based—no need to learn additional programming languages.
    - Comprehensive documentation available in the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

**Tip:** Bookmark the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) as it is the definitive resource for all Foundry-related questions.

## Development Environment

- The course uses **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as the main code editor.
- VS Code is lightweight, powerful, and available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- It supports extensive extensions, making it excellent for smart contract development workflows including writing, testing, deploying, and interaction.

# Foundry Installation & Setup — Notes

## 1️⃣ Preparing Your Terminal
**Recommended Terminal**
- **Windows:** Use WSL / Ubuntu terminal
- **macOS / Linux:** Use default terminal or preferred shell

**Clear Terminal**
- Type `clear` + Enter
- **Mac:** `Command + K`
- **Linux / Windows:** `Control + K`

**Terminal Controls**
- **X button:** hides terminal but keeps history
- **Trash icon:** stops running processes and resets terminal

## 2️⃣ Installing Foundry

1. Open the Foundry installation page:  
   https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation

2. Run the installation command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```
Ensure internet access for successful downloading.

## 3️⃣ Verifying Installation
1. After installation, terminal output confirms shell detection and Foundry added to your system Path.

```bash
foundryup
```

2. Confirm installation by checking Forge's version:

```bash
forge --version
```

# How to Format Solidity Code in VS Code

## Importance of Code Formatting

- Unformatted Solidity code is hard to read, debug, and maintain.
- Proper formatting distinguishes keywords, variables, functions, and comments.

## Setting Up VS Code for Solidity

### Using VS Code Extensions

- Extensions provide syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, and formatting.
- Recommended Solidity extensions:
    - **Solidity by Nomic Foundation (Hardhat):** Provides rich syntax highlighting and formatting, works well with Foundry projects.
    - Solidity by Juan Blanco.
    - Solidity Visual Developer by tintinweb.
- To install:
    - Open Extensions view (`Ctrl + Shift + X`).
    - Search for "Solidity by Nomic Foundation" and install.
- For `foundry.toml` syntax highlighting, also install **Better TOML** extension.

### Security Warning

- Always verify extension publisher to avoid installing malicious copies.
- Examples of attacks with fake extensions are documented online.

## Configuring Default Formatter

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`).
2. Select **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**.
3. Add or update with:

```json
{
  "[solidity]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity"
  }
}
```

4. This sets the Nomic Foundation extension as the default formatter for .sol files.
